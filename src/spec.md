# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update site branding to “MALANCHA TAILORING TRAINING-CENTER” across visible UI text, SEO/sharing metadata, and brand image assets.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all visible instances of “MINAKHAN SKILL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING CENTER” with “MALANCHA TAILORING TRAINING-CENTER” (header, hero, footer, copyright, and any other remaining UI text).
- Update `frontend/index.html` SEO/sharing metadata fields to use “MALANCHA TAILORING TRAINING-CENTER” (title, meta description where applicable, Open Graph, Twitter), keeping metadata text in English.
- Add new logo and favicon assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` with updated naming, and update all frontend references and alt text to use the new assets/name (including favicon and any social preview image references).

**User-visible outcome:** The website consistently displays “MALANCHA TAILORING TRAINING-CENTER” in the UI and browser/preview metadata, with updated logo and favicon reflecting the new name.
