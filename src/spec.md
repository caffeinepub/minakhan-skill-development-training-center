# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update site branding to “MINAKHAN SKILL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING CENTER” across visible UI text, SEO/sharing metadata, and logo assets.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all user-visible occurrences of the old training center name (“Bidhathi Training Center” / “Bidhathi Skill Development Training Center”) with “MINAKHAN SKILL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING CENTER” (e.g., header, hero title, footer, and any other headings/labels).
- Update SEO/sharing metadata to use “MINAKHAN SKILL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING CENTER” (HTML title, Open Graph title, Twitter title, and any other metadata fields that contained the old name), keeping metadata text in English.
- Update site logo assets to the new name and change all logo references in the UI and social preview metadata to point to the updated assets.

**User-visible outcome:** The site consistently displays “MINAKHAN SKILL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING CENTER” in the header, hero, footer, and other visible text, with matching updated browser/SEO titles and updated logo/favicon branding.
